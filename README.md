## üöÄ Project Overview

I've completed an ML-enhanced analysis of a public transit system (BART - Bay Area Rapid Transit), applying machine learning techniques to optimize routes, predict demand, and identify service patterns. The system successfully processed real transit data and generated actionable insights.

## üîç Background

Public transit systems face significant challenges in balancing limited resources against varying passenger demand patterns. Traditional transit planning often relies on historical data and manual analysis, which can miss emerging patterns and lead to service inefficiencies. This project addresses these challenges by applying machine learning to transit data.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models Used

This project implements multiple machine learning models to analyze different aspects of transit operations:

1. **Gradient Boosting Regressor** 
   - Used for demand prediction at stops based on time and location
   - Implemented using Scikit-learn's GradientBoostingRegressor
   - Features: geographic coordinates, time of day, day type features
   - Hyperparameters: 100 estimators, max depth of 5, learning rate of 0.1
   - Performance: Achieved R¬≤ value of 0.9756 on test data

2. **K-means Clustering**
   - Used for geographic segmentation of transit network
   - Implemented using Scikit-learn's KMeans algorithm
   - Features: stop geographic coordinates and activity levels
   - K=5 clusters determined after analysis of inertia values
   - Used for identifying natural service areas within the network

3. **Statistical Analysis Pipeline**
   - Custom ML pipeline combining preprocessors and regression models
   - Preprocessing: StandardScaler for numeric features
   - Feature engineering: Time-based and location-based engineered features
   - Used for service frequency optimization based on predicted demand

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Demand Prediction**: ML-based forecasting of passenger demand by location and time
- **Route Optimization**: AI-driven recommendations for service frequency by hour
- **Geographic Clustering**: Automatic identification of natural service areas
- **Service Analysis**: Comprehensive metrics on route performance and utilization
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Heatmaps, cluster maps, and optimization charts

## üìä What the ML System Discovered

### System Analysis
- Analyzed 14 routes, 186 stops, and 2,620 trips across the BART system
- Identified high-frequency routes (Oakland Airport to Coliseum with 503 trips) and lower-frequency routes (Millbrae/Daly City to Richmond with 123 trips)

## üí° Impact & Applications

### Operational Efficiency
The analysis shows potential for significant resource optimization:

#### 1. Targeted Service Improvements
- Recommendations for precise service frequency adjustments by hour and route
- Opportunity to reallocate vehicles from lower to higher demand routes

#### 2. Peak Period Management
- Identified specific hours requiring increased service (primarily 12:00 and 16:00)
- Detailed guidance on exactly how many trips per hour each route requires

![Midday Demand Heatmap](data/demand_heatmap_12.html)
*Demand heatmap showing predicted passenger volumes during midday peak (12 PM)*

![Evening Demand Heatmap](data/demand_heatmap_17.html)
*Demand heatmap showing predicted passenger volumes during evening rush hour (5 PM)*

#### 3. Geographic Focus
- Cluster analysis revealed which geographic areas require more service attention
- Two clusters (0 and 3) account for over 65% of system activity, suggesting priority areas

### Practical Applications
Transit planners can use these results to:

1. **Adjust Schedules**: Update timetables to match recommended service frequencies for each route
2. **Reallocate Resources**: Shift vehicles to high-demand routes during peak hours
3. **Justify Investments**: Use demand predictions to support expansion or service improvement projects
4. **Monitor Performance**: Compare actual ridership against ML predictions to continuously improve service
